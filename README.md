Todo---app---project:
Todo App Project — Smart. Simple. Structured.
todo---app---project is a clean, modular, and specification-driven Todo application built with a strong focus on clarity, scalability, and best development practices. The project follows a well-structured architecture using a dedicated `src` layer, separating concerns across CLI handling, services, storage, and models. Designed with productivity in mind, it demonstrates real-world Python project organization, Git version control, and Spec-Kit based planning. This app serves as both a functional task manager and a learning-oriented reference for building maintainable, professional-grade Python applications.
